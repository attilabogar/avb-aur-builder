## Description

This project can be used to build AUR packages in docker containers using `docker-compose`.

It's precedes my own AUR override packages description from
[avb-aur](https://github.com/attilabogar/avb-aur) over any official'
[AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org).

The order of the packages passed to the `build-pipeline.sh` is relevant, as
packages down the list may depend on packages built first.  Figuring out and
flattening the dependency order is the user's responsibility.

The list of package names can be passed as args or as a simple textfile, where
each line is a package name.  Moreover, the two methods can be mixed.

The precedence for `build-pipeline.sh` resolving ARGV as follows:

  1. first looks for a directory named as ARGV (useful for debugging builds)
  2. non-empty text file (containing list of packages)
  3. downloads the AUR (precedence as described above)

## Requirements

  - docker
  - docker-compose

The setup of specific repositories, such as `multilib` is your responsibility.
The docker image built upon
[archlinux/base](https://github.com/archlinux/archlinux-docker) - you can check
my patches I use for archlinux and archlinuxarm in the `contrib/` directory.

# Structure

  - `build-pipeline.sh` (the main script)
  - `repo/` (the local repository - packages end up here)
  - `build/` (the build workspace)

## Example

To build [Google Chrome](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/google-chrome), run
`./build-pipeline.sh google-chrome`

To build a more complicated flow, such as imapsync, put the packages into `aur-imapsync.txt`
```
perl-par
perl-par-packer
perl-test-mock-guard
perl-json-webtoken
perl-mail-imapclient
perl-ntlm
perl-sys-meminfo
perl-unicode-string
imapsync
```

Then run `./build-pipeline.sh aur-imapsync.txt`
